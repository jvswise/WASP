Sample WIPE program: HalloweenTst
This program runs a twinkling effect alternately in two colours (purple
and orange) with different twinkling rates.
NOTE: Line 50 has a newline \n character at the end which should
      be entered as '\n' (unquoted). The listing display is a WIPE
      anomaly--which may or may not get corrected.
