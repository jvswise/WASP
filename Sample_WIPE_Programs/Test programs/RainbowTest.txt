WIPE sample program file: RainbowTest

This is an initial, small test program (written in the WIPE language and
for the WASP Interactive Programming Environment) to exercise most of
the language features and a few of the standard functions. It runs
thru a loop 10 times, each time running the Rainbox effect (Rain()) for 
3 seconds, then the RainbowCycle() effect (Cycle()) for 3 seconds.
Each time thru the loop, the speed of the effects is increased
(Speed()). The function prints the current Rainbow/RainbowCycle
stage (print) each time thru the loop.

To run this program, connect a terminal emulator to the WASP Controller
node (via the Arduini/Moteino Serial console port). In the command
line, enter:
  program
This takes you to the WASP Interactive Programming Environment (WIPE),
a WIPE interpreter. You can enter WIPE environment commands (e.g. dir)
and can also enter WIPE programming language statements for immediate
execution (e.g. print "hello world"), much like with old BASIC
interpreters or modern Python programming environments. Copy the
program statements below into the console (including the statement
line numbers). Then enter:
  run

You will need to have at least one WASP slave node powered up and
connected to an addressable RGB LED string. The slaves will respond
to the program running on the WASP controller.

NOTE: Lines 105 and 125 have a newline \n character at the end which should
      be entered as '\n' (unquoted). The listing display is a WIPE
      anomaly--which may or may not get corrected.
